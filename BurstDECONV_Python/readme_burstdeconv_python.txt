We provide a Jupyter notebook containing the analysis pipeline. The notebook can be 
used if you have Python and Jupyter installed. Alternatively, if you don't have
or don't want to use Python on your computer use our docker container (see Docker_burst_deconv_manual.pdf)

Steps for using the Python notebook
0.  if you don't use docker, run the requirement file to install requirements by typing from the command line (Command prompt on Windows, terminal on Mac/Linux):
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook by typing from the command line (Command Prompt on Windows, terminal on Mac/Linux):
jupyter notebook
2. Select BurstDeconv notebook  BurstDeconv.ipynb and visualize it (view)
3. Change the value of numberOfWorkers to be smaller than the Maxmimum number of threads
4. Change the DataFilePath and output folder to be one of
	- sample_data1  for artificial data generated by a 2 states model, 4 transcription sites (choose this for a start if your computer has a low number of threads)
	- sample_data2 for artificial data generated by a 2 states model, 100 transcription sites
	- sample_data3 for artificial data generated by a 3 states model
5. Choose the preprocessing package; for the sample example choose readDrosoData_1spot
6. The results of this notebook are available in the  sample_data/output folder as follows
	- images contains the result of pre-processing (the MS2 signals for the different cells)
	- matFile/npzFile  contains the result ot the deconvolution as a mat/npz file
	- resultDec contains same thing as npzFile
	- Results contains excel files with parameters of different models folder *_result contains plots of data

The notebook has a cell that calls the fit function required for mixed long+short movie data. the arguments of the function are:

path = 'path/to/deconvolution_results/' Example :- '../../resultDec/'
parameter = 'path/to/parameterFile' Example :- '../../hivparameters.npz'
combined = either 0 or 1, default = 0 (the data from several files will be pooled together)
visualize = 0 or 1, 1 means all the plots will be opened in a window.
outputpath = 'path/to/output/the/result' Example :- '../../output_folder'
